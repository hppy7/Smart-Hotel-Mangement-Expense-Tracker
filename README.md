## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps to set up the environment:

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-hotel-expense-tracker.git
cd smart-hotel-expense-tracker

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Set up the Database
Run the database setup script to initialize the required tables:

bash
Copy code
python create_tables.py
Step 5: Run the Application
Start the Flask application by running:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the web application. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to access the tracker.

How It Works
1. Expense Tracking
The application allows users to input daily hotel expenses, including purchases, salaries, and utility costs. It automatically updates the financial records in the database.

2. Inventory Management
The system also tracks inventory, such as food and beverage stock levels, as well as toiletries and other essential supplies, ensuring that items are restocked in a timely manner.

3. Reporting
The tracker generates detailed expense and inventory reports, allowing hotel managers to analyze and optimize their operations.

Troubleshooting
Virtual Environment Issues
If the virtual environment becomes "locked" (you cannot install or uninstall packages), it may be due to a corrupted pip cache. To fix this:

Deactivate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
deactivate
Remove the venv folder:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf venv
Recreate and activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
cd venv\Scripts
.\Activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
Reinstall dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
